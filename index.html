        <p style="text-align:left:"> I love to be creative using all different mediums and types of materials. I usually have a mixed media style but now I am going to a more fun Kawaii style that I love. I want to start making my own stickers and ephemera to sell online. </p>

        <p style="font-size:12px">
        <p style="text-align:right:"> Minatures is a fun activity we do on the job. We hide minatures and collect them. I am getting a display to showcase my favorite minatures. Anyone who participates can purchase some to hide and share with others. Some are reasonably priced and it is not too expensive of a hobby. </p>
